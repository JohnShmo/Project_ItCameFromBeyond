*It Came From Beyond* is a work-in-progress mod for the game [Starsector](https://fractalsoftworks.com). It aims to add
additional content and mechanics to the game.

## Requires

[LazyLib](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=5444.0), [MagicLib](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25868.0).

## Features

- ***New campaign factions***
  - The Boundless: A group of humans that arrived from a distant sector via a unique form of faster-than-light travel
  called a "Shift Drive". [UNFINISHED]
  - Shifters: ***REDACTED*** [UNFINISHED]
- ***New spaceships***
  - Three new playable frigates. [UNFINISHED]
  - Three new playable destroyers. [UNFINISHED]

  - Two new playable capital ships. [UNFINISHED]
  - Several new utility and logistical ships. [UNFINISHED]
  - Several unboardable ***REDACTED*** ships. [UNFINISHED]

  often may also attract some "unwanted" attention. [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]
