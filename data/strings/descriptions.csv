icfb_boundless,FACTION,"The Boundless are an enigmatic faction that formed as an officially recognized polity just a few dozen cycles ago. The majority of their leadership and high-class citizenry are survivors who arrived in the sector aboard a massive generational ship called 'The Wings of Enteria'. According to witnesses and researchers, it appeared suddenly, and with a flash of energy violent enough to shatter a nearby moon. Boundless officials constantly try to downplay these very provable claims, but it's difficult to determine their purpose in doing so. Their laws, regulations, and political practices boarder on the edge of paranoia.

In terms of governance, the Boundless maintain a centralized, authoritarian regime with an emphasis on information management. Their citizens are monitored closely, with regular loyalty screenings and strict enforcement of laws to ensure compliance. Dissent is not tolerated, and those who question the state often disappear under mysterious circumstances. However, this rigid system has its benefits: the Boundless are highly organized, efficient, and capable of mobilizing their fleets with little notice. Their military is designed around strategic defense and calculated offense, and their leaders are often pragmatic to a fault.

Despite their harsh internal policies, the Boundless are not overtly expansionist, at least not yet. Instead, they prefer to engage in strategic alliances and trade agreements, often acquiring resources or technology through less aggressive means. However, their motives remain opaque, and many factions - especially the Hegemony and the League - keep a wary eye on them, unsure whether the Boundless are merely biding their time before revealing their true intentions.",,,,,,,
icfb_wings_of_enteria,CUSTOM,"A hulking mass of half-molten metal and forgotten dreams serves as a shell around a newly constructed megastation. Materials from the old generational ship were used to build ports, industrial centers, and various other facilities required of a more stationary, and permanent colony. The construction efforts are still underway to this day, as the broken appearance and debris stand testament to. Certain groups within the Boundless have petitioned to maintain this ghastly husk as a reminder of where they came from, and as a warning to those that know a 'forbidden truth'. The station that now occupies the core of the ship hums with activity, slowly overtaking the ancient vessel in scale and complexity. But the old ship’s presence looms large, with jagged, blackened metal framing the station like the skeletal remains of a colossal creature. ",,,,,,,

icfb_kaldur,SHIP,"Barely capable of unassisted hyperspace travel in the absence of a carrier, the Kaldur-class corvette is a staple patrol craft used by the Boundless. It's flimsy and vulnerable - but also cheap and easy to deploy. The ship is often used to bring ordinance to the front lines.",,,,,,,
icfb_froskur,SHIP,"The Froskur-class frigate is a general-purpose combat platform fielded regularly by Boundless patrols. It is relatively bulky, outfitted with strong armor and a flexible weapon loadout. The frigate's base speed and maneuverability leave much to be desired, but it is capable of rapidly adjusting its position via powerful auxiliary thrusters.

The Froskur-class has a long-standing reputation among Boundless crew members, often referred to as 'Old Reliable' due to its versatility in various combat scenarios. It's not uncommon to find veterans who have served aboard multiple iterations throughout their careers, as the ship has been through countless refits and upgrades over the cycles. Rumor has it that the thruster design originated from an early prototype meant for asteroid mining rather than combat; many captains rely on it for daring last-second maneuvers.",,,,,,,
icfb_karta,SHIP,"A spiritual 'big brother' to the Froskur-class frigate was designed rather early in the history of the Boundless, or so they say. In truth, it's difficult to determine the exact timeline surrounding some of these ship designs. With relatively powerful thruster package, the role filled by the Karta-class destroyer seems to be a heavy strike craft, but its standard weapon layout betrays this. Either way, it's proven to be very effective as an escort package for larger fleets.

The Karta-class destroyer holds a somewhat mythical place in Boundless history. According to some, the original schematics were lost in a sabotage attempt during the faction's infancy, and the current version was reverse-engineered from fragments of the blueprints that survived. Despite being classified as a destroyer, the Karta has a peculiar weapon loadout - optimized for defense rather than offense. This oddity led to early confusion about its role in the fleet, though it's now commonly deployed as an escort for capital ships.",,,,,,,
icfb_vik,SHIP,"A staple of Boundless enforcer fleets, the Vik-class destroyer is the last word in forward firepower. Similar to the smaller Skjoldr-class, the destroyer can pump specialized munitions into its ammo feeds to adapt its offensive capabilities based on the tactical situation. Outfitted with a reinforced forward armor and a staggering array of frontal weapon mounts, the Vik-class excels in breaking through enemy lines and spearheading assaults.",,,,,,,
icfb_skjoldr,SHIP,"The Skjoldr-class heavy frigate is little more than a trio of heavy armaments with engines to send them into war. It sports impressive flux-dissipation for its size, and the ability to pump its weapons with ammunition specialized for its current target's weaknesses. Do not underestimate this ship design, since it can punch well above its weight in a brawl. One of its more glaring weaknesses, however, is its lack of dedicated point-defense mounts.",,,,,,,
icfb_vindur,SHIP,"The Vindur-class cruiser is among the most advanced ships of the Boundless fleet. It sports a unique focus on energy weapons, instead of relegating them to secondary or support roles. The cruiser competes with others in its size-category to be the 'definitive' wedge-shaped ship, but it has some tough competition given its status as a late arrival in the Persean Sector.",,,,,,,
icfb_hakarl,SHIP,"The Hakarl-class battlecruiser is a formidable, albeit unconventional, capital ship fielded by the Boundless fleet. Its defining propulsion system relies on a series of controlled explosive charges, detonated behind an immense reinforced back plate, propelling the ship forward in rapid bursts. This method grants the Hakarl-class impressive acceleration and top speed for a vessel of its size, allowing it to reposition swiftly during engagements - though the ride is rough for its crew.

Early testing of the ship’s explosive propulsion resulted in several high-profile accidents, leading some within the Boundless to question the viability of the design. These mishaps gave the Hakarl-class a notorious reputation long before it ever saw battle, and even now, there are whispers that serving aboard one is a cursed assignment. The battlecruiser's namesake, a large predatory sea creature from Boundless homeworld mythology, speaks to its nature.",,,,,,,

icfb_ballistic_preloader,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Frontloads ammunition racks with special charges. Projectiles fired by ballistic weapons after using the system deal bonus damage, up to a certain number of shots (depending on the weapon). Generates flux on use.",,,,,,,
