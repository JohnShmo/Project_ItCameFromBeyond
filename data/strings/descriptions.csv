icfb_boundless,FACTION,"The Boundless are an enigmatic faction that formed as an officially recognized polity just a few dozen cycles ago. The majority of their leadership and high-class citizenry are survivors who arrived in the sector aboard a massive generational ship called 'The Wings of Enteria'. According to witnesses and researchers, it appeared suddenly, and with a flash of energy violent enough to shatter a nearby moon. Boundless officials constantly try to downplay these very provable claims, but it's difficult to determine their purpose in doing so. Their laws, regulations, and political practices boarder on the edge of paranoia.",,,,,,,
icfb_wings_of_enteria,CUSTOM,"A hulking mass of half-molten metal and forgotten dreams serves as a shell around a newly constructed megastation. Materials from the old generational ship were used to build ports, industrial centers, and various other facilities required of a more stationary, and permanent colony. The construction efforts are still underway to this day, as the broken appearance and debris stand testament to. Certain groups within the Boundless have petitioned to maintain this ghastly husk as a reminder of where they came from, and as a warning to those that know a 'forbidden truth'.",,,,,,,

icfb_froskur,SHIP,"The Froskur-class frigate is a general-purpose combat platform fielded regularly by Boundless patrols. It is relatively bulky, outfitted with strong armor and a flexible weapon loadout. The frigate's base speed and maneuverability leave much to be desired, but it is capable of rapidly adjusting its position via powerful auxiliary thrusters.",,,,,,,
icfb_karta,SHIP,"A spiritual 'big brother' to the Froskur-class frigate was designed rather early in the history of the Boundless, or so they say. In truth, it's difficult to determine the exact timeline surrounding some of these ship designs. With relatively weak shields and a powerful thruster package, the role filled by the Karta-class destroyer seems to be a heavy strike craft, but its standard weapon layout betrays this. Either way, it's proven to be very effective as an escort package for larger fleets.",,,,,,,
